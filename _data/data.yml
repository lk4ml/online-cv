    summary: 
      Summarise
      I would like to make an impact by teaching physics in the easiest way possible and develop love for physics in
      my students. I am a student for life and hence i feel learning never stops. I keep on finding new ways of teaching 
      the concepts and break down those in the easiest way possible.
